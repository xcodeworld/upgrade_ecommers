## Project Overview
This project is an online marketplace for customers to browse products, add them to their cart, and place orders. It provides a user-friendly interface and backend features for product management, authentication, and more.

## Technologies Used
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for storing product, user, and order information.
- **Express.js**: Backend framework to build APIs and handle HTTP requests.
- **React.js**: Frontend library for building the user interface.
- **Node.js**: Server-side runtime environment.

## Project Setup

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (v14 or higher)
- **MongoDB** (locally or via a cloud service like MongoDB Atlas)
- **Git** (for version control)

2. Navigate to the backend folder:
    ```bash
    cd backend
    ```

3. Install backend dependencies:
    ```bash

    SECRET_KEY = -Va2EH7IA2G5xDyz8LNsWJ7r8m0
    
    ```

5. Start the backend server:

    npm run server
    ```

### Frontend Setup

    npm install
    ```

3. Start the React app:
    ```bash
    npm start
